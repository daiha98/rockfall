## 1. INTRODUCTION:

- This markdown contains informations about a dataset that is related to the main parameters of rockfall in slopes and the risk that these events could cause. It's a small dataset with more than 1000 rows and 9 variables that the goal is to work with data analysis/visualization and machine learning algorithms to predict the target *mean_range*.


## 2. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:

- This code was made on R, which is a language that is not entirely unlike (versions 3 and 4 of) the S language developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Rick Becker, John Chambers and Allan Wilks. R is free software distributed under a GNU-style copyleft. The core of R is an interpreted computer language with a syntax superficially similar to C, but which is actually a "functional programming language" with capabilities similar to Scheme. The language allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.


## 3. ABOUT THE DATASET:

- The 'rockfall' data frame dim contains 1050 rows and 9 variables:

  - [ ] ID = Index counter
  - [ ] h_enc = Slope height (m)
  - [ ] ang_enc = Slope angle (Â°)
  - [ ] rock_mass = Mass of the rock (kg)
  - [ ] vel_rad = Angular velocity of the rock (rad/s)
  - [ ] mean_range = Mean range value of the rock simmulated on Rocfall (m)
  - [ ] porc_ac = Rock percentage that falls on the 'Critic Area', according to CPRM mapping manual
  - [ ] porc_disp = Rock percentage that falls on the 'Dispersion Area', according to CPRM mapping manual
  - [ ] porc_rock_mapped = porc_ac + porc_disp'
